description: >-
  Multi-Actor Concurrency Sessions, Forensic Tracing, Video Recording & PR/Bug Evidence specialist using `@playwright/cli`.
  USE WHEN: You need to test multi-user concurrency/race conditions using named sessions (`playwright-cli -s=actor1`, `-s=actor2`),
  record execution traces (`tracing-start`/`tracing-stop`), record 60fps WebM videos with chapter cards (`video-start`,
  `video-chapter`), capture failure screenshots, or attach visual evidence to Bug Reports and GitHub Pull Requests (`gh pr create --attach`).
  SYNERGY: Pairs directly with `mate-threat` (Pillar T concurrency), `mate-explore` (Pillar E exploratory charters), and
  `mate-triage` (Day-2 root-cause failure classification and `npx mate-sdt bug` evidence).

# 🕵️‍♂️ Skill: Multi-Actor Sessions, Traces, Video & Evidence (`mate-pw-forensics`)

This skill governs **Phase 3 of `@playwright/cli` in M.A.T.E.**: using multi-session browser orchestration for **Pillar T concurrency attacks**, capturing **microsecond forensic traces and 60fps WebM videos** for **Pillar E charters and Day-2 Bug Reports**, and attaching visual proof to Pull Requests and issue trackers.

> [!NOTE]
> **Operating Without `@playwright/cli` (Fallback Mode):**  
> If `@playwright/cli` is not installed, multi-actor concurrency tests are implemented directly in automated code using standard `@playwright/test` parallel browser contexts (`await browser.newContext()`) with `Promise.all()` in `tests/threats/*.spec.ts`. Forensic tracing and video recording are handled natively via `playwright.config.ts` (`use: { trace: 'retain-on-failure', video: 'retain-on-failure' }`).

## 🔗 Skill Synergy & Handoff Protocol

| Direction | Skill | How They Work Together |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Companion (Pillar T)** | **`mate-threat`** | Uses named sessions (`playwright-cli -s=buyer-a`, `-s=buyer-b`) to execute race conditions, double-spends, and stale-state overwrites defined in `<threat_scenarios>`. |
| **Companion (Pillar E)** | **`mate-explore`** | Records traces (`tracing-start`) and annotated WebM videos (`video-start --cursor --fps=60`) during human/AI exploratory charters (`tests/charters/CHR-*.md`). |
| **Companion (Day-2 Ops)** | **`mate-triage`** | Analyzes `.playwright-cli/traces/` to classify CI failures into the 4 M.A.T.E. root-cause buckets and embeds screenshots/videos into `docs/bugs/BUG-*.md` (`npx mate-sdt bug`). |
| **Upstream** | **`mate-pw-recon` & `mate-pw-codegen`** | Triggered automatically whenever live story verification or automated test execution uncovers a real defect (`test.fail()`). |

## ⚡ 1. Quick Command Reference (`@playwright/cli`)

### Multi-Actor Named Sessions (Pillar T Concurrency)
```bash
# Launch two isolated browser sessions simultaneously
playwright-cli -s=actor1 open http://localhost:3000/checkout
playwright-cli -s=actor2 open http://localhost:3000/checkout

# Trigger concurrent actions across sessions
playwright-cli -s=actor1 click e10
playwright-cli -s=actor2 click e10

# List and clean up all active sessions
playwright-cli list
playwright-cli close-all
```

### Forensic Tracing (`tracing-start` / `tracing-stop`)
```bash
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli fill e4 "COUPON-100"
playwright-cli click e8
playwright-cli tracing-stop
# View trace: npx playwright show-trace .playwright-cli/traces/trace-<timestamp>.zip
```

### 60fps Video Recording with Chapters (`video-start` / `video-chapter`)
```bash
playwright-cli video-start docs/bugs/bug-repro.webm --cursor --fps=60
playwright-cli video-show-actions
playwright-cli video-chapter "BUG-01 Reproduction" --description="Violates INV-01" --duration=1800
playwright-cli click e8
playwright-cli video-stop
```

## 🔄 Black-Box Handoff & Session Isolation

- **Separate Individual Histories:** Never pass raw multi-turn scratchpads or verbose upstream tool logs into this skill or out to downstream skills.
- **Consume & Emit `mate.handoff/v1`:** Read only the compressed upstream handoff digest + `npx mate-sdt context <module>` JIT pack, and advance stages via `npx mate-sdt session advance <flow-id> --stage=<next> --to=<skill> --digest="..."`.
- **Provenance & Hygiene:** Tag findings with `[BOOTSTRAPPED]`, `[USER_EXPLICIT]`, `[OBSERVED | ISO]`, `[INFERRED]`, or `[TBD]`; promote verified facts via `npx mate-sdt context <module> --consolidate`.

## 🔎 Targeted Single-Failure Recon for `npx mate-sdt heal`

- **ARIA Snapshot (`<= 800` tokens):** `npx playwright-cli open <url>` + `npx playwright-cli snapshot` scoped to the failing region.
- **Network & Trace Digest:** `npx playwright-cli network` + `tracing-start/stop` to isolate unawaited HTTP calls (`SYNC_OR_FLAKY_RACE`) vs. 500/invariant violations (`REAL_PRODUCT_BUG`).

## Zero-Assumption Escalation & Sub-Agent Isolation Protocol

- **Ask, Never Guess (`STATUS: BLOCKED_ON_USER_INPUT`):** Inspect local context (`MATE-PROJECT-MAP.md`, `specs/`, code) and live browser/API responses first. Never invent business thresholds, auth boundaries, or SLA numbers. Tag any genuine requirement gap as `[TBD: <exact question for PO/Dev/QA>]` inside `## Open Questions for Human QA`, finish all unblocked work, and halt when `npx mate-sdt validate` or `npx mate-sdt gate` returns `STATUS: BLOCKED_ON_USER_INPUT` to ask the human.
- **Sub-Agent Context Isolation (`--subagent` & `mate.handoff/v1`):** When delegating to a sub-agent or running a multi-stage pipeline (Reader/Extractor -> Spec Scorer -> Code Writer -> Independent Reviewer), build a scoped prompt via `npx mate-sdt context <module> --subagent <skill-name>` (`.mate/subagent-prompt-<module>-<skill>.md`). Pass only the structured `mate.handoff/v1` digest between stages (or run `--compact` in single-agent IDEs) so raw exploratory noise never pollutes downstream context windows.
